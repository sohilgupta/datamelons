DISCLAIMER: This plugin has been heavily tested, however it does require above average technical knowledge.  Please use it at your own risk and do not forget to back up your files and databases beforehand with other backup system.  Please do not attempt to use the plugin if you're new to WordPress or have a limited technical background.  Please seek out professional help if your in question of anything.

DEVELOPERS: This tool is great for pulling a production site down onto your local machine for testing and validation. It also works great for developing locally and then pushing up to a production server for a first time site release.

NOTE: This project is currently in Beta, the underlying logic to perform all these migration tasks is quite involved. It's impossible to know how each system is setup; this is why your feedback is important to us.  Thanks for helping us to make WordPress the best blogging platform in the world.
