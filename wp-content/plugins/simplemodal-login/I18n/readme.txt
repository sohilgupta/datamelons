If you are interested in translating SimpleModal Login, use simplemodal-login.pot as a template to create a po file for the new translation file.

The resulting translated file should be named with the following format:
- simplemodal-login-
- ISO 639 language code (lowercase)
- an underscore
- ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (uppercase) 
- .mo

So for an Italian translation, the file name would be simplemodal-login-it_IT.mo

Please *do not* translate URL's or placeholders, such as %s.

Please send the translated file to eric@ericmmartin.com.

Thanks!
