Single and multi-level menus for your WordPress site, styled with customizable menu templates.

== Description ==

With Menubar you can easily build and manage single and multi-level menus for your WordPress site.

* Build your menus selecting item types among Home, FrontPage, Heading, Tag, TagList, Category, CategoryTree, Page, PageTree, Post, SearchBox, External, PHP, Custom, in any combination

* Display a menu inserting in your theme, e.g. at the end of *header.php*, the line
<br>**&lt;?php do_action ('wp_menubar', 'your_menu_name_here'); ?&gt;**

* Use the *Menubar* widget to display your menus in a widget ready area or sidebar

* To style your menus, select one of the default Menubar templates, customize your selected template, or use the CSS from your theme

* Customized Menubar templates can be moved into an independent folder, so you can upgrade to a new Menubar version without losing your changes
